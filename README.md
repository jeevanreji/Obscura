## **Background**

### **Everyday Incidents**
Imagine a simple scenario: A group selfie is shared on social media, but someone’s ID card is visible in the image. This exposes sensitive information like their name, workplace, and ID number, creating risks of data exploitation or phishing attacks.  

### **Professional Risks**
- Employees frequently share screenshots containing confidential data such as financial reports, proprietary code, or sensitive client details.
- These actions, while intended for legitimate use, can expose organizations to potential data breaches, reputational damage, and legal ramifications.

### **Personal Risks**
- Casual screenshots shared within personal contexts may reveal sensitive details like home addresses, phone numbers, or financial information.
- Such leaks can lead to targeted phishing scams or identity theft.

## **Market Gap**
Existing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions:
- Focus on manual review or automated text redaction.
- Neglect images and video files, leaving a critical vulnerability unaddressed.
- Are often time-consuming and prone to human error.

## **Our Solution: Obscura**

Obscura fills this gap by:
- Providing **proactive and automated image-based DLP**.
- Leveraging **machine learning** to identify and obscure sensitive content.
- Being **platform-agnostic**, adaptable for various communication and email platforms.

## **How It Works**
### **Step-by-Step Process**
1. **Image Submission**: The user uploads an image to a Slack channel (demo example).
2. **Content Analysis**: Obscura scans the image to detect and process sensitive information.
3. **Image Delivery**: The bot replaces the sensitive content in the image and sends the updated version to the intended receiver.

### **Key Differentiators**
- **Controlled Access**: The receiver only gets the processed image, not the original, adding an extra layer of security.
- **Enhanced Privacy**: By adopting on-premise large language models (LLMs), enterprises reduce risks of data leakage while maintaining high performance.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Obscura’s engineered prompts can be fine-tuned for specific enterprise or user use cases.

## **Next Steps for Obscura**
1. **User Nudges**:
   - Notify users of potential risks before an image is sent.
2. **Customizable Enterprise Features**:
   - Allow enterprises to build additional filters based on IT policies.
   - Provide an option for custom prompt configurations to create tailored data loss prevention rules.
3. **Broader Integration**:
   - Extend platform compatibility to other messaging and email platforms for holistic protection.

## **Why Obscura?**
1. **Mitigates Data Exposure**: Protects enterprises and individuals from unintentional information sharing.
2. **Platform-Agnostic Design**: Can integrate across messaging platforms like Slack and email services.
3. **Future-Proof**: Easily adaptable with customizable options for evolving user and enterprise needs.

## **Demo Details**
### **Platform**: Slack
Used for the demo due to its widespread adoption among enterprises, especially Fortune 100 companies (80% usage).

- The demo highlights:
  1. How images are processed for sensitive content.
  2. How the updated image is shared securely with the intended recipient.
